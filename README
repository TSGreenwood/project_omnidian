    <h3> Objective </h3>
        <h4>Create a machine learning model that can, based on recorded telemetry,<br> categorise assets into groups indicating potential service requirements.<br>  Validate the results of this model’s categorisation with training and testing data.<br>  Build public-facing website which protects Omnidian’s proprietary information, as well as the personal information of their clients.<br>  Moreover, I intend to communicate the process in detail to Omnidian for reproducibility and potential business use.<br>  While I am not currently an employee, my work does represent their brand.<br>  I will review text information with them to ensure the writing is an accurate and positive representation of their work.<br>  Omnidian is hiring for their first Data Scientist.<br>  They have had over 200 applicants, most of which have more education and experience than I.<br>  I plan to use the supportive environment here at Flatiron School to gather<br>  deep understanding of their data environment, their goals for the future, the up-to-date methodologies, the interpersonal rapport and the<br>  concrete business results that will give me an inside track to the job.</h4>
