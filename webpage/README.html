    <h1 id="summary"> Making Solar Energy More Accessable by Classifying<br>  Common Field Maintenance Issues</h1>

    <h2><Introduction/h2>
        <h3>Clean energy is very important to me. That’s why I built a machine learning model to predict the root causes of field maintenance issues for a real company. Keeping overhead costs as low as possible is helpful for any business.</h3>
    <h2>About <a href=">https://www.omnidian.com/">Omnidian</a> </h2>
        <h3>Omnidian is a Seattle startup that ensures "solar without fear" to homeowners and businesses across the country. New solar owners can subscribe to  a 95% performance guarantee plan. If Omnidian can’t resolve it, they’ll actually pay subscribers for their loss of solar energy. </h3>
        <h3>Their software models expected output for each asset (solar panel generation site) and compares it with the actual output. If an asset underperforms, they take steps to fix it, often sending one of their service partners to address the issue. </h3>
        <h3>Omnidian gave me a wonderful opportunity to make alternative energy accessible to normal people. They generously gave me free access to their databases, their domain knowledge, and the autonomy to teach myself the skills necessary to build the models. It’s been a wonderful experience working with great people working to make the future better for all of us.</h3>
